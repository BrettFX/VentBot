Hey Jack, so arc consistency pertains to a pair of nodes or states having a valid domain to each other.  Note that if we make a graph arc consistent and the result is an empty domain then the problem is unsolvable. Thus, in the RGB graph, we ensured arc consistency by comparing two adjacent states and making sure they were bound to their domains and satisfied the constraints. So yes, arc consistency ensured that no two adjacent nodes had the same color. 
Sorry for the delay Jack. I just got back from the exam for is448. That's definitely a useful resource. Yes, you are correct. The queens would be the variables and the chess board is the graph (a rather complex one at that)
Also, I shared my notes document with you for 471
It went pretty well. I got a 100% lol
Very good. I need to crack down on the studying. This is the first chance I have to study lol
Thanks man haha. Yeah there will probably be an expected value minimax problem on the exam. 
With the dice 
Hopefully haha
Hey for the A* search problem on the from of the old midterm, do you know what the updated priority is for?
from the old midterm*
Oh okay that makes sense. Would you be able to show me an example of what you have for the table  for that problem?
Great! Thanks man
Awesome man! I really appreciate that! Thank you. I'm going to get something to eat at my apartment and then I can meet up to study with you. Did you still want to meet in the Commons? 
Where are you? 
Alright cool I'm omw from Walker. 
Alright I'm here. 
What did you think of the exam? 
I didn't do well
I just didn't know what to do in various parts so I put a logical guess...
For instance, the Sudoku part and the T/F graph part 
I had no idea what to do. That exam literally insulted my intelligence 
Hey Jack, what did your graph look like for the hard test on project 2 for AI? 
Alright one sec
Ahh my bad. One second lol
Nice I got the graph but I haven't done the points yet. One second, I need to get to a computer to send you the hard test. 
from math import sin, cos, pi
 
def sinc(x):
    if x == 0:
       return 1
    return sin(x) / x
 
def my_func(x, y):
    return sinc(x**2+y**2)

I think that is what is going on... The z-axis is always between -1.01 and 1.01
My graphs are all messed up because of the z-axis I think
I run it with the following command: python local_search.py old_hard.txt -20 -20 20 20
So what would you set the z bounds for that?
Oh wow! Thanks man!
That makes sense! Thanks!
Oh nice. Okay cool!
Right so perhaps the graph on Wolframalpha depicts the asymptotes? 
Right
Okay cool that makes sense
Oh wow dude, that's freaking awesome!
Nice!
So just to clarify, for this project, are we supposed to first find all the points(x, y, z, step) in a path to the maximum of the provided function and then use those points when graphing?
Alright cool
Interesting. 
I wonder why 
Hmm I will get to that point and let you know if you haven't figured it out by then 
Oh awesome! Have fun man!
Will do. 
Np man
I haven't gotten to that point yet. But, I would just use the functions that he provides
Btw what were the x and y values that you found that maximizes the functions for the medium and hard test?
Alright cool that's exactly what I got
But I think I'm having problems with mine. The random restarts are making it so that there are random points everywhere until the initial state is the maxima
True. Setting random restarts to 100 works for the easy and medium test but not for the hard test. I ended up just using 500 and now it works for all of them all the time... But yeah I'm just having troubles plotting I guess. I'm working on it now. I should be able to solve it soon
What is your initial step size? How much do you increment it by?
Oh okay lol. So how do you get the color to change to red?
I think I may have accidentally implemented gradient assent as well haha
But that makes sense, thanks!
Darn
I'm still not having any success with trying to change the color of the points based on the value of z
Thanks man. Unfortunately, I didn't have success with that
Hey Jack, how are you? We you able to fix your simulated annealing algorithm?
Yeah I noticed you had posted that question
My bad dude I just realized you had texted me!
Thank God the project is not due today haha
My bad Jack! I will send the results as soon as possible!
Sorry for getting the annealing results to you so late man. Here are the results for simulated annealing based on the function z = -((x + 1)^2 + y^2) + 1 is

You're welcome man
I will have to see by later tonight. I'm still getting flash cards together. I can probably be there around 11:30 or so. 
Lol. 
Good morning Jack. I'm going to study independently for this exam. Sorry man.
Hey man, the information gain I got for the split on humidity was 0.048
Entropy(Target, Humidity) = P(Humidity ≤75) * Entropy(4/5, 1/5) 
+ P(Humidity >75) * Entropy(5/9, 4/9) 
 
Information Gain = Entropy(Target) – Entropy(Target, Humidity) 

I hate when that happens. Check out this video if you need help figuring out entropy and information gain. It's pretty much a walk-through of this homework assignment but with slightly different attribute values: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O__7lAqni7A 
For information gain of the split on Outlook?
I got 0.249 for that
Check out that video man, it really helps
Are you factoring in the probability of playing and the probability of not playing?
Yeah the overcast entropy is 0
Entropy for Sunny should be 0.971 and the Entropy for Rain should also be 0.971
Why are you weighting them?
I didn't do that
I took the entropy of the Target class and the outlook
Lol I'm going to keep it the way I have it now. Oh well haha
Check out that video though
I think I'm doing some weighting but not in the same way
I feel like this assignment will be graded leniently since he didn't really give an adequate example in class
Exactly
And I think there are different 'flavors' of calculating entropy, i.e., machine learning, chemistry, etc.
Alright cool because that is what I ended up doing. 
Nice work man !
Nice man! I was at work all day. I will have to look at it soon. 
No I haven't seen it posted. I hope there's not one due this Wednesday. That would be pretty messed up if she creates one and posts it on Monday and then has it due on Wednesday! 
That's crazy. 
Yeah man I just finished it
You need help?
There is not just one correct answer
Try testing all possible combinations of x1 and x2 against the following: (x1 + w1) + (x2 + w2) <= t; if true then 0, else 1
No problem man, you're welcome
Hey man, for the project, what do you do once you have chosen the first split.  If we were to use the decision tree homework as an example, after we choose the split on outlook because it yields the greatest information gain, what would we do next?
That's what I was thinking but I was getting confused. Thanks man!
True. There are many variations of weights and threshold values that replicate the truth table of an AND gate though. 
Hey Jack did you go to the Commons? 
Alright cool. Would you like to study a bit for AI? 
Hold on I'm omw. 
Hey man, my bad. Yeah I have the 436 book. 
Hey Jack do you have an update as to what time you'd be able to study today? 
I know how you feel man. I will have to look at that. I don't know off the top of my head.
No problem. Yeah man that sounds like a good idea. When would you like to meet? 
Sounds like a plan man. Keep me posted. 
Hey Jack, the answer to that question you sent to me is Principle Component Analysis btw
You're welcome
Hey man, in case you haven't figured out the homework yet. It was really simple to find P(c) after all. You just have to find P(c | a)p(a)
That sounds like a plan. You are going to do fine man. You did well on the previous exam. Just do your best and forget the rest. I think there will be quite a few questions on the algorithms. 
Alright cool. I will keep you posted on when I will head to the Commons to meet up with you
True. But don't let that discourage you. You can do this! Keep your eyes on the prize
Btw the  prof. still hasn't extended the project deadline. I'm going to remind him in class tomorrow if he hasn't pushed it by then!
Haha yeah I was just thinking about it and decided to take a peek to see if he had extended the deadline yet
My bad man, I missed this text. No the exam is not cumulative. Only the final is
Good morning Jack, how are you?

So I have class until 12:45p and then I'm going to head back to my apartment to get something to eat. Shorty after, I will head to the Commons to meet up to study with you if you are there. 
Alright cool
I think you should just be able to describe what each layer does and the process of image recognition. Also, know what a local perceptive field is. 
No problem.
Yeah that section is pretty tough. But it is so freaking fascinating to me! 
Lol true. That's why these projects are so helpful. 
Alright man I'm heading to the Commons now. Are you in Flat Tuesday's? 
What did you think of the exam? 
Sorry about that man. I was looking for you but didn't see you. I ended up heading back to my apartment.

That exam was ridiculous. I hate how there were so many problems that required super in-depth understanding of the algorithms. Like the PCA graph problem. Where the heck did that come from?!
Yeah I gave my best guess at that one lol
No, the c-constant pertains to SVMs
It was asking about high and low c values, i.e., high or low slack
Yeah so the high value c-constant gives better generalization. That's the one where you draw the maximum margin hyperplane. The low c-constant promotes accuracy.
The higher c-constant doesn't care as much if their is a miss-classification of data (or just points that are on the wrong side of the line).
Yeah fortunately there were some outliers in the dataset
